## How to fold a paper airplane

1. Source an A4 sized paper of any colour. 
2. Fold the paper in half using the long edge and reopen the folded paper but ensuring there is a clear line 
3. Now while holding the top right corner fold your paper towards the midline you created in step 2.
4. Repeat step 3 for the top left half of the paper.
5. Once you have brought the two edges to the same point in the paper, the top half should look like a triangle.
6. Now fold the triangled paper as you have done in step 2. 
7. Next hold the top of the folded triangled paper and fold only half of the sides in an outward direction back on to it's self. 
8. Now bring back the folded halves of the sides to a horizontal plane.
9. The paper you have folded should now resemble a paper airplane.
10. Aim at 45 degrees and throw. It should fly to some extent.

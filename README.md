## How to fold a paper airplane

1. Source an A4 sized paper of any colour. 
2. Fold the paper in half using the long edge and reopen the folded paper but ensuring there is a clear line. *At this point you can decorate the top half of the paper with your favorite images, words an colours.*
3. Now while holding the top right corner fold your paper towards the midline you created in step 2.
4. Repeat step 3 for the top left half of the paper. **ensure both sides are equal in legths by ending up at the same point.**
5. Once you have brought the two edges to the same point in the paper, the top half should look like a triangle. *pointy side at the centre of the top section of your papre*
6. Now fold the triangled paper as you have done in step 2. 
7. Next hold the top of the folded triangled paper and fold only half of the sides in an outward direction back on to it's self. 
8. Now bring back the folded halves of the sides to a horizontal plane.
9. The paper you have folded should now resemble a paper airplane.
10. Aim at 45 degrees *(any angle as long as it is not facing downwards. well unless you want to fly it towrds the ground)* and throw (not very hard). 
11. Depending on how well you could decipher my steps the plane should fly some distance.
